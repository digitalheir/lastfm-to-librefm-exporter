# Export scrobbled tracks from Last.fm and import them to Libre.fm
https://digitalheir.github.io/lastfm-to-librefm-exporter/

A bare-bones Last.fm exporter as a web app, requiring no installation.

This program is modeled after the program "[lastscrape-gui](https://github.com/encukou/lastscrape-gui)". The difference is that for lastscrape you have to install Python and the Qt framework, and you might not want to take this effort.

Usage is roughly the same as described in [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/foobar2000/comments/3zaiy6/guide_to_librefm_scrobbling_lastfm_backup_to/) under the section "Backing up from last.fm to libre.fm":

> Before you proceed now, make sure that you have [disabled automatic scrobbling from libre.fm to last.fm](https://libre.fm/user-connections.php) (it's off by default). You don't want the tracks you scrobble from last.fm now to return and re-register in last.fm while importing them to libre.fm.
